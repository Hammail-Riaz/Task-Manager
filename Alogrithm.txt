Computation Thinking:

    1. Abtraction: 
        user auth and crud ops

    2. Decompostions:
        using two blueprints i.e auth and task management

    3. Pattern recognitions:
        - database to stored data about user and task with models
        - flask wtf cutom build forms
        - blueprints for each tasks
